# COVID-State-Performance-Analysis
A Jupyter notebook analysis of state performance related to COVID deaths on a gross and per capita basis

This is my second Python project, which I used to learn the Pandas/Numpy and Matplotlib/Seaborn libraries, as well as Jupyter notebooks. It is essentially a substantially improved version of my first project, prepared as a report comparing relative state performance in management of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic.
